# Synopsis

Implementation of Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to understand if choices in stochastic environment are driven by reinforcement learning. 
Another important aspect of this analysis is how parameters of Q-Learning model change as a function of choice history adaptation. 
Summary of findings are presented in "Qlearning_Summary_v1.ai"
